# Crop-Yield-Prediction: A Sustainable Development Research Project

  This research project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield and recommend suitable crops for a given district based on factors like temperature, rainfall, and land area. By applying machine learning techniques, the project aims to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability in India, a country where agriculture remains a vital yet underpaid occupation. The models developed in this project help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to plant for maximum yield, ultimately boosting income and reducing risks associated with crop selection.

# Project Overview

  Agriculture in India faces numerous challenges, including uncertain crop outcomes and suboptimal crop choices. Machine learning offers a transformative opportunity to improve yield predictions and crop recommendations. This project focuses on predicting crop yield using various machine learning models, evaluating their performance based on mean absolute error (MAE). By considering key factors such as temperature, rainfall, and land area, these models guide farmers in selecting the right crops to maximize yield and improve profitability.

# Required Libraries:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
- XGBoost
- Streamlit

Make sure all libraries are installed before running the scripts.

# Models Used:

1. Logistic Regression:  
   Logistic regression is a statistical model commonly used for classification tasks. It models the dependent (output) variable as a binary or categorical value using a logistic or sigmoid function. In this project, an L2 regularized logistic regression model was employed for experimentation. While logistic regression is typically used for classification, it can also help in predicting categorical outcomes in crop yield prediction.


2. Random Forest:  
   Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique based on bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), where multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the data. This method enhances prediction accuracy by averaging the results of many individual models, reducing variance and overfitting. Random Forest handles missing data and outliers well and is parallelizable, making it efficient in training large datasets.

3. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost):  
   XGBoost is an ensemble method based on gradient-boosted decision trees, where each successive model corrects errors made by the previous ones. In this approach, models are added sequentially until no further improvement can be made. XGBoost uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function and is particularly effective for large datasets with complex patterns, making it a powerful tool for crop yield prediction.

# Using Streamlit for Interactive Interface:   

  Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface for the crop yield prediction models. With Streamlit, farmers can easily input relevant data (e.g., temperature, rainfall, area size) and instantly receive predictions and crop recommendations generated by the machine learning models. The user-friendly interface provides visualizations of model outputs, performance metrics, and other useful insights, making it accessible even to farmers with limited technical expertise. This integration of Streamlit allows for real-time crop recommendations and predictive analytics, helping farmers make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

# Conclusion

  The machine learning models developed in this project offer valuable insights for farmers by predicting crop yields and recommending the best crops to grow based on specific environmental factors. The results of these models are compared using the mean absolute error (MAE) to determine their accuracy, helping farmers make data-driven decisions that maximize productivity and sustainability in agriculture. The integration of Streamlit enhances user experience by providing an interactive platform that delivers real-time predictions and insights, ensuring that farmers can act on information promptly and effectively.
